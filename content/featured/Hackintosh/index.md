I built a hackintosh for Asus zenbook ux333 and other similar specs. Using data from [Dortania's Opencore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and [Olarila](https://www.olarila.com/), I'm happy for anyone to use or build on it. But nowadays, the opencore version has gone a long way, so it might be difficult to upgrade from this version to the new version.
